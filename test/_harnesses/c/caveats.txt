- assumes IEEE 754 floats and doubles
- assumes little-endian host (for now)
- struct layout mirrors the order of the protocol file, which may raise warnings about padding on some compilers
    - if this is important to you, optimize the order of the members in your protocol file
    - except for:
        - sidecar length variables, els_len
        - also _mt at start of struct
- new structs not necessarily zeroed
- allocates and rewrites pointers during read
- strings and lists need to be freed
    - make {namespace}_free_{MessageType} functions?
- no utf-8 decoding; just gives, takes, and measures a set of bytes -- doesn't guarantee that it's null-terminated, etc.
- only uses macros for error-checking; otherwise tries to be as straightforward as possible
- note struct/message declaration order issue
- STB-style header-only library
todo
- will need a destroy list function
- default struct function?
