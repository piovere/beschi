- assumes IEEE 754 floats and doubles
- assumes little-endian host (for now)
- portability across OSes?
- sidecar length variables on messages
    - could we do a safe strlen to get message length?
    - unicode makes that hard :(
- new structs not necessarily zeroed
- allocates and rewrites pointers during read
- strings and lists need to be freed
    - make {namespace}_free_{MessageType} functions?
- no utf-8 decoding; just gives, takes, and measures a set of bytes
- struct layout mirrors the order of the protocol file, which may raise warnings about padding on some compilers
    - if this is important to you, optimize the order of the members in your protocol file
